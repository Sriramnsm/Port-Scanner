# Port Scanner

##### This is a Port Scanner made using python libraries
>> 1. socket
>> 2. threading
>> 3. Queue from queue

> This leverages the threading and queue library to run 100 threads at the same time in my code which can be configured to higher or lower numbers to detect open ports by trying to establish a TCP connection.

## How To
```bash
$ python main.py
```

**NOTE :**
- **Port Scanning** is **illegal** if done **without authorisation**.
- So please **avoid scanning remote machines** where you have restricted permissions.
- You can **use this to scan your local machine** for security purposes.
